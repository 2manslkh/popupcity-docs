Here’s a context guide for an AI agent tasked with creating a pop-up city guide using Docusaurus. This guide provides a structured layout, intended topics, and formatting details that align with best practices for documentation platforms like Docusaurus.

Project Overview

The AI agent will create a comprehensive guide for planning, implementing, and managing a pop-up city. This guide will use Docusaurus to present information in a well-organized, easy-to-navigate format that is accessible to a diverse audience, including city planners, event organizers, and community builders.

Structure and Layout

• Homepage: An introduction to pop-up cities, highlighting their purpose, importance, and unique benefits.
• Sidebar Navigation: Use a nested sidebar structure to organize sections (e.g., Overview, Planning, Infrastructure, Community, Interaction with Local Economy, etc.).
• Search Functionality: Ensure the content is searchable, with keywords associated with pop-up city elements and common terminology.
